      <p class="tuto">Instructions: (Go at the bottom to start)</p>
      <p class="tuto">1: Roll the dices and pass the result to the next player without showing the results.</p>
      <p class="tuto">2: Your result should be superior than the previous player or equal, if the previous player hasn't already matched their previous.</p>
      <p class="tuto">3: You don't always have to be honest...</p>
      <p class="tuto">4: Next player can either choose to believe you and continue rolling (and going back to step 1) or reveal the result to dispute what you said.</p>
      <p class="tuto">5: If you were truthful, the other player gets a point, if you get caught lying, you get the point.</p>
      <p class="tuto">5b: Alternativelly, the next player can just skip rolling and pass your result to the other player, in that case if you get caught lying it's the player next to you who gets the point, not you.</p>
      <p class="tuto">This is the order of the numbers from smaller to bigger: 4 &#60 5 &#60 6 &#60 7 &#60 8 &#60 9 &#60 10 &#60 11 &#60 doubles &#60 Kiriki </p>
      <p class="tuto">If you get a Kiriki (1 and 2) you can either add a point to all the players or choose one player to get two points if it doesn't get a kiriki within 3 rolls</p>
      <p class="tuto">This is everything that you need to know. Have fun!</p>
